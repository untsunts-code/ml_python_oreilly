This repository is to add all the exercises worked from the O'Reilly book. Personal Development stuff... Trying to become a better robot. 

## book's introduction

...
This is an introductory book requiring no previous knowledge of machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI).
We focus on using Python and the *scikit-learn* library, and work through all the steps to create a successful machine learning application. 
...
You will get the most out of the book if you are somewhat familiar with Python and the *NumPy* and the *matplotlib* libraries.

We made a conscious effort not to focus too much on the math, but rather on the practical aspects of using machine learning algorithms. 
As mathematics (probability theory, in particular) is the foundation upon which machine learning is built, we won't go into the analysis of the algorithms,
we recommend the book *The Elements of Statistical Learning* (my next repo) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, which is available for free at the [authors' website](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
We will also not describe how to write ML algorithms from scratch, and will instead focus on how to use the large array of models already implemented in *scikit-learn* and other libraries.

Â¡YAY! (capicua)
### now, let's do this
